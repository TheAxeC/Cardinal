First you should get acquainted with the source code and the documentation.

The issue tracker shows all of the TODO's that still need to happen. If you find new bugs, you can submit them there.
If you have any other issues, request, ..., you can also submit them.

+#### Making a change
The basic process is simple:

- Fork the repo so you can change it locally. Please make your changes in a separate feature branches to make things a little easier.

- Change the code. Please follow the style of the surrounding code. That basically means camelCase names, 
 { on the same line, and four spaces of indentation. If you see places where the existing code is inconsistent, let me know.

- Send a pull request.

If at any point you have questions, feel free to submit an issue or email me (axel.faes at gmail.com). Thank you!
