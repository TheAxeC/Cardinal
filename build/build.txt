Generating makefiles:

To generate the correct project files using cmake you need to call cmake using the following line:
	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. (in the build/release folder)
	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .. (in the build/debug folder)

Should you want to generate the correct files for a specific buildset (eclipse, mingw)
See if it is available using: cmake --help
Then call:
	cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. (in the build/release folder)
	cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .. (in the build/debug folder)
